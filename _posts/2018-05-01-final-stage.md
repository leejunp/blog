title: Final Stage
---

I have finished coding all of my individual review sites since that is the easiest one to get down. Moving onto each of the main pages, I am currently working on my upcoming page. Since you cant have hover effects on mobiles, I am redesigning it to look something like the app store's front page on iPhones. Simple rectangular shapes with a drop shadow and one image.
