title: The Progress in Code
---

For this class, I was able to finish coding the main page of my website. It is fully functional with some hover features, and I would like to add more micro-interactions when I have the chance. I will now focus on getting down my four other webpages and try to make a few blog posts to see how it would look like. As for user testing, I gave my coded website to my friends and they had a few comments:

1. They did not quite understand the point of the circles on the bottom, they're redundant and useless (I will probably remove it?)
2. The color scheme is nice and coherent.
3. More micro-interactions would be helpful.

My progress so far has been uploaded on leejunp.github.io/ggwp.
