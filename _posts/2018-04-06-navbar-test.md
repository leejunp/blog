After coding the navigation bar, I gave it to my friends so they can test it out. Luckily for me, everyone understood where to click and actually found it convenient. I believe the experiment was a huge success and will continue to build the site with a side nav bar. In contrary to what I mentioned before, I think my site is going to be mostly white. It looks cleaner and simpler, which is how I am aiming to design.
