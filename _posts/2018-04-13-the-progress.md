Continuing from last week's progress, I coded in some user interactions, game search engine, and the game review pages. Last week I received a critique that the user doesn't understand the point of the two circles on the bottom so I decided to make them into a 'subscribe and report' page. Instead of leading the user to a whole new page, it simply triggers a pop-up and leads them through a simple process of signing up or reporting bugs. Otherwise, I implemented the search bar in the 'Games' section and coded the review pages. From here on out, I am going to develop the page further by making a rating section (ex. 9 out of 10) and a Pros and Con section. It will be placed directly under the header so the viewer gets an easy overview before reading the whole entry.
