I am a gamer. I’ve been playing video games ever since 6 years ago when my friend convinced me to start League of Legends, a MOBA that took entered the world with a bang. From League, I branched out into many different types of games and realized one big problem: there isn’t a site that honestly reviews video games and keeps them up to date. In order to find accurate information, the user has to go through countless numbers of blogs and videos to figure out an overall rating of a game. So for this final project, I have decided to create a platform in which I can write about my own opinions while pulling together other people’s review and compiling them so users can access the information easily. The website will be kept up to date will all patch notes and remakes since games change drastically with each changes.

I am going to have my friends (they're all gamers) use and review my site throughout my process. I can have at least 5 constant reviews and eventually give it to a bigger audience by making a post in a gaming community website. The way I can test for the success is by looking it how comfortable the users are with my site and their revisits.
