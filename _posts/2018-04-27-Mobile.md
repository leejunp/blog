Coding the responsive side of my website was a bit tricky. Since I tailored everything to be viewed on a desktop or a laptop, I had to redesign a lot of things about GGWP. Due to some family circumstances, I am a bit behind on my schedule so I will have to sit down and focus on the responsive css coding soon. For now, I was able to make an Adobe XD sketch of what I foresee my mobile site to look like. In order to do so, I collected various inspirations from places like Dribbble, Instagram and Awwwards. Below is an example of what I want.
