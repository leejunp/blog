<img src="Images/Home.png" alt="home">

For GGWP (common term gamers use to show respect for the enemy team) I am going to focus on monochromatic colors. Since most tech users enjoy ‘Night Mode’ I am going to have a dark background for the majority of the pages with a splash of color using images. Above is an example of my home page: the logo will serve as the ‘Home’ button and a simple navigation bar on the right-hand side. From the UX perspective, I am not too sure as to how well a side navigation bar will work out especially since the words are angled as well.
